									<h3>Find the right colleague with ‘On the Move’</h3>
                    <h5>Are you looking for a colleague?</h5>
                    <p>Ask Anja, or better still, use the app she invented, called ‘On the Move’. Where did she get the idea? </p>

                    <p>Anja de Jong, assistant to the Deputy Minister of Justice and Security, often needs to find the right people in the department quickly. What about the online Government Address Guide? Not up to date. And, says De Jong, you can’t search on terms like Job Description or Area of Expertise, because such information hasn’t been stored. ‘This makes finding someone quite a challenge.’ So she came up with her own solution: an app called ‘On the Move’. It contains the names, job titles, contact details and areas of expertise of all J&S employees. This app was one of the three finalists in the J&S Innovation Pitch 2016. There was general enthusiasm for it. Clearly, De Jong wasn’t the only person needing quick access to this type of information. She asked her IT colleagues for help, but it turned out that her idea wouldn’t be easy to put into practice. So the J&S IT Service Centre called in the national government’s Shared Service Centre ICT and asked the Innovation team to come with a flexible (technoly independant ). Together with the J&S Service Centre, the developers designed an app that makes use of existing information, such as the Government Address Guide, but is easier to use.</p>

So the J&S IT Service Centre called in the national government’s Shared Service Centre ICT and asked the Innovation team to come with a flexible (technology independent) and open-source solution for this challenge. Together with the J&S Service Centre, the innovators designed an app that makes use of existing information, such as the Government Address Guide, but is easier to use.  About fifteen colleagues are participating in the trial, and more will join them in due course, says De Jong. ‘Eventually, everybody will be able to use the app.’</p>
